cleanStream // make sure there's nothing weird - This shader is meant to be analogous to colorbynormal but for 2D.
dumpWindowInfo // window info starts at position 1 in stream
dumpVertex // vertex info starts at position 5 in stream
rdivide 5 1 // dividing index 5 by index 1 into index 1, this is x position
rdivide 6 2 // dividing index 6 by index 2 into index 2, this is y position
modVertex 6 1 // position 6 in float[] version of vertex3f, which is red. setting to index 1's value (xpos/xsize)
modVertex 7 2 // position 8 in float[] version of vertex3f, which is green. setting to index 2's value (ypos/ysize)
out        // output vertex3f. IN SUMMARY, this sets vertex color to R = xpos/xsize, G = ypos/ysize, B = B, A = A
