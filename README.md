## JoshCo Game Engine
Hello, and welcome to a technological innovation of the century! 
The latest JoshCo Game Engine is here and open source for all.

Unfortunately, we all know it sucks. If you'd like to help make it suck less, here's some basic rules to follow when fixing our crapbucket:

- Do not break any old code.
  - This means COMPLETE compatibility. If a set of functions doesn't work together the *exact* same way they used to before whatever you did, don't commit it.
- Code courtesy.
  - If you have *good and efficient code*, realize Benis exists. It's shitty code if you don't at least explain the seemingly nonsensical parts.

There are some exceptions. For example, the shitbucket that currently is the co.josh.engine.Vector3f/org.joml.Vector3f conversion problem. Fundamental issues as big as that are worth a couple broken things.

glhf!
